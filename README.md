Driver's Amigo is a IoT project that i made using Arduino Uno to help drivers park the car at the right place in a garage, it shows LED indicators and alert driver if coming too close to another objects like bikes or stuff in garage. Feel free to use the code for your project and ask me if any questions @curiousadhvik
